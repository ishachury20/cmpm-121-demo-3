# cmpm-121-demo-3

Please note: When the player is near the OAKES CLASSROOM location, there are 4 caches that do not work. These caches do not become invisible outside the player's range or accurately reflect the number of coins. This bug only affects these 4 caches. All other caches have been tested and are fully functional, following the assignment requirements. 
These are the caches to be ignored: 
- Cache at (36.98959, -122.06307)
- Cache at (36.98959, -122.06317)
- Cache at (36.98929, -122.06287)
- Cache at (36.98939, -122.06237)


This is the default `README.md` file for the D3 projects. If the student is
aware of what's going on in their project, they should immediately replace this
with something more descriptive. It sure would be embarrassing if they forgot to
do that...
